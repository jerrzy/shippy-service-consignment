1. apparently micro v3 is completely different to micro v2. everything in the post doesn't even compile under v3.
2. have to delete v3 exe for being able to use v2 go dependencies. for sure the micro.exe and protoc-gen-micro.exe on micro v3 are quite different to micro v2.
    the v3 imports micro v3 go dependencies to the go files.
    the v2 imports micro v2 go dependencies to the go files.
